# The-7-Basis-of-Programming
Story describing the 7 basis of programming

The 7 basis of programming are the foundation of java, if you master all of it you know almost everything about java, and these are the list of the 7 basis of of the programing.
Primitive Types
Statement
Arrays
Static Methods
Strings
Input and Outputs
Data Abstraction

With the primitive type what we learn so far is that primitive types specifies the types and size of variriables values.
Primitive types are bytes, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char. For example
int= 5 which are whole numbers.
Float = 5.99f which are fraction or decimal numbers.
Char = 'A' which are single character with single quote.
Bool = True or False.
String = "Aisha" collection of character with double quote.
ASCII = Letters, numbers, and other characters.

Statement
A statement is a direct instruction that tells the computer to do something, and it ends with a semicolon also a method is a kind of a statement because it ends with a semicolon too.

Static Method
A static methods means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, unlike public method which is an access modifier used for class.

String is a variable that contains a collection of characters sorrounded by double quotes.and also we learn about variables which is a kind of name holder and a variable name is an identier which is the kind of name you can make in your code.

Scanner keyboard
The scanner is a class to get user input, it is found in java.util package, it is use to parse text for strings and primitive types using regular expresssion.
